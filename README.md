#Seting the Repo Up

##Using a virtual environment
1) In Terminal, run the following: python3 -m venv .venv
2) VSCode should notice that a new virtual environment was created, and will prompt in a popup asking if you want to use it - tell it that you do.
3) In VSCode, open a new Terminal if you're not seeing "(.venv)"in the prompt, create a new Terminal.

##Installing the required dependencies

In Terminal, run the following: pip install -r requirements.txt

_Note that Pygame has some dependencies that may have to first be installed on your computer. https://www.pygame.org/wiki/MacCompile may help._
