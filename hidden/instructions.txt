#Seting the Repo Up

##Using a virtual environment

In Terminal, run the following: python3 -m venv .venv
VSCode should notice that a new virtual environment was created, and will prompt in a popup asking if you want to use it - tell it that you do.
In VSCode, open a new Terminal if you're not seeing "(.venv)"in the prompt, create a new Terminal.
##Installing the required dependencies

In Terminal, run the following: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Note that Pygame has some dependencies that may have to first be installed on your computer. https://www.pygame.org/wiki/MacCompile may help.
